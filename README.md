# eiv
Implementation of a POC language where everything is a variable

To compile and run, install rust and do:
``cargo run``

With this, you'll have access to the basic cli of the interpreter.

To run individual files, you can just pass them as a parameter.

An overview of the syntax can be seen [here](src/tests/)
